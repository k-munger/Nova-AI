# Nova - Personal AI Assistant
Nova is an AI assistant designed to improve your daily life by collecting and storing your data locally. Unlike other AI assistants, Nova goes beyond just making suggestions, it will actually implement changes and test the effects on your life to determine if it improves or not.

Nova will be able to determine what is important to you, such as work meetings, doctor appointments, etc., and make changes to your schedule so that those appointments will not be affected. However, before implementing changes, Nova will thoroughly test the effects against the new patterns to determine how life has improved.

# What is Nova for?

Nova is for anyone who wants to take their productivity to the next level and streamline their daily life. With Nova, you can automate your daily routines, allowing you to focus on what's important. Whether it's freeing up time for personal activities, or optimizing your schedule, Nova is the perfect solution.
